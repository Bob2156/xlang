	Tensor is a multiple dimensional array whith same data type
	compare with list which hold each item at least take 16-bytes
	(X::Value), but Tensor will reduce memory usage
	for example Tensor of float, each item just take 4-bytes
	and Tensor also can hold X::Value as its item, then item can be
	vairant data type
	in this Implementation, use templeate to define this Tensor
	class, and will register for diffrent type of Tensor
	include: 
		int, float, double,complex and X::Value
	maybe also include char as item to reduce memeory 
	in some case use as flags
